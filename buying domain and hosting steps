These two videos (and other online research)

indicated to me that the best option is to buy domain name and hosting separately, 
and that the best places to currently buy are: 

For domain purchase : https://www.namecheap.com
For hosting : https://www.siteground.co.uk/ 

==================================================================================
==================================================================================

1) Buying a domain.

i) Go to https://www.namecheap.com/, find the domain name you want and add it to the cart.

I bought petelancaster.com for 2 years for £14.28 total.

I did not add any options such as email hosting, web hosting, SSL etc. I guess they can 
be added later if required.

ii) I'm new to namecheap, so I had to create an account.

iii) I did not select automatic renewal. This could also be a mistake.

OK. That's done. You can now enter the dashboard and see what you've bought.

iv) Clicking around in NameCheap later on, I see the following: message (within the dashboard):
"You have 15 days left to verify contact info." and I also see "Alert!" next to the petelancaster.com
domain listing.

Apparently I should have recieved and email about this, but in my case I haven't. 

Here are the NameCheap instructions if you don't recieve the email.

https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/797/67/what-should-i-do-if-i-didnt-receive-the-approval-email

I've done this and got the email (in junk email folder). Clicked on the link in the email
and reached a namecheap.com page containing this message: 

    Registrant email address successfully verified
    Your site(s) will automatically (re)activate, usually within 24 - 48 hours.

    petelancaster.com
    You can see your Registrant email address by logging into your Namecheap Account 
    and going to the Domain Management section. You can update this information at any time.
    
Going back into the dashboard within NameCheap, I can see that the "You have 15 days left to verify contact info."
message has disappeared, and so has the "Alert" next to the petelancaster.com domain, so it looks like
job done.

==================================================================================
==================================================================================

2) Buying hosting.

i) Which hosting do I want? 

https://www.siteground.co.uk/ offers "Web hosting", "WordPress hosting", "Woocommerce hosting".
These appear to be essentially identical offerings with different marketing messages attached 
(so that potential purchasers don't go elsewhere because they are doubtful that the offering 
meets their needs).

I'm going for the "WordPress hosting" option at £5.99 per month.

ii) Choosing your domain.

I've already bought my domain petelancaster.com, from (https://www.namecheap.com), so I enter
this in the relevant box as part of purchasing hosting.

iii) I'm new to https://www.siteground.co.uk/, so I have to create an account.

I did not purchase extra services like SG Site Scanner.

Done. Hosting cost £86.26 for one year.

iv) This is the message I see within SiteGround immediately after hosting purchase 
complete: 

Point Your Domain
Please point your domain to the new host server. Your new DNS are:

DNS THAT I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO STORE IN PUBLIC GITHUB FOLDER
DNS THAT I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO STORE IN PUBLIC GITHUB FOLDER

Essentially this is about pointing my petelancaster.com domain purchased via NameCheap 
to the hosting purchased via SiteGround, so to implement you take the two DNS above 
and go to NameCheap, and follow the instructions here.

https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/767/10/how-to-change-dns-for-a-domain/

For cases like mine, where your domain name purchase was via NameCheap, but your hosting purchase
was via somewhere other than NameCheap, this boils down to 

  NameCheap/Domain List/NameServers/Custom DNS/ 
  Then add in Nameserver 1 and Nameserver 2 in the space provided.
  Then click on green checkmark to save.

3) Setting up wordpress website.

Within siteground dashboard, just selected "setup new website" (as opposed to importing existing), and selected "WordPress" 
and set up login details (for WordPress, which are separate and distinct from SiteGround login).

Steps as per this vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKyoKk9T4g4

Wordpress has now been installed in the backend of your site by SiteGround. There is probably a more involved step-by-step
way of doing this (if you feel compelled to do it the hard way).
